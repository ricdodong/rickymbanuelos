It all started when I bought an Ubiquiti LiteBeam AP 120 (LAP120) for my client. I am impressed by its capability to transmit 120 degrees. That's why I wanted to use LAP120 as a transmitter or sender for my TP-Link CPE605 receivers, but the problem is that this LAP120 is designed to be visible only on their Ubiquiti products. To solve this problem, we will flash a custom firmware like OpenWRT. I have tested a lot of their firmware versions, but almost all of them did not work on my device except this one.

***Requirements:***

1. [WA.v8.5.7.38314.180628.1036.bin](WA.v8.5.7.38314.180628.1036.bin)
1.

1. 


[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/download/WinSCP-6.3.2-Setup.exe/download)

1. Tftpd64
1. At least Windows 10 64bit OS.

### **Part 1: Flashing firmware to Version 8.5.7**

#### **A - Set Static IP Address**

#### **B - Flashing with Tftpd64**

Put your LAP120 device into recovery mode by pressing and holding the reset button while plugging in the PoE adapter and release it after 30 seconds.On the Tftpd64 click the put button, if not working click the break button and click the put button again. In my case I've tried this steps 2-3 times until I succeeded

C - Set Default Username and Password for ssh connection.

After successful flashing your device will restart and then you can set the username and password to be used by the ssh connection later on.
